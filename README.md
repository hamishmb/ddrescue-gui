# DDRescue-GUI

This repository holds DDRescue-GUI, which is available under the GNU GPLv3+.

NOTE: Source code for GNU ddrescue is available via https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/

Description of Package
======================
A simple GUI frontend to make GNU ddrescue easier to use.

Packages
========

Linux Distribution Packages
===========================

You can find these at https://www.launchpad.net/ddrescue-gui or https://www.hamishmb.com/html/downloads.php?program_name=ddrescue-gui.

Windows bundle
==============

The Windows bundle is free for a certain number of downloads each month (200 at the time of writing), and is available for a small fee after that, to help fund Windows development of DDRescue-GUI.

The Windows bundle can be downloaded from https://www.hamishmb.com/html/downloads.php?program_name=ddrescue-gui.

The scripts and instructions used to create the Windows bundle can be found at: https://gitlab.com/hamishmb/ddrescue-gui-windows-installer.

macOS bundle
============

The macOS bundle is free for a certain number of downloads each month (200 at the time of writing), and is available for a small fee after that, to help fund macOS development of DDRescue-GUI.

The macOS bundle can be downloaded from https://www.hamishmb.com/html/downloads.php?program_name=ddrescue-gui.

Creating a macOS bundle
-----------------------

Step 1: Compiling GNU ddrescue
------------------------------

I compiled GNU ddrescue 1.25 on macOS 10.9 with Xcode. After installing Xcode, one can simply cd into the source and run:

    ./configure
    make

To produce the same binary I have in the repositories here.

Step 2: Bundle creation
-----------------------

Python 3, wxPython, DDRescue-GUI, GetDevInfo, and all of their dependencies need to be installed.

You also require the following extras:
- The py2app python module.

After this, a bundle can be generated by running:

python3 ./setup-macos.py py2app

And then running the scripts in other/macos-scripts to configure the bundle correctly.

**NOTE:** As Python, its modules, and macOS are continually developed, it is very possible that a bundle you create is not identical to my official bundle. As such, I will provide **absolutely no support** for custom bundles, or issues encountered with DDRescue-GUI when using a custom bundle.

Furthermore, developing, packaging, and testing DDRescue-GUI for macOS is an extremely time-consuming and difficult process, and macOS (especially the hardware it runs on) is also not a free product. As such, if you find DDRescue-GUI useful I would very much appreciate it if you could donate a small amount of money to help me fund this project, which can be done in the footer of the page at https://www.hamishmb.com/.

Creating a macOS source package
-------------------------------

This is currently a manual process that requires extensive knowledge to do correctly without omissions, so instructions are not provided here. I hope to produce an automated script for this in the near future.

Documentation
=============
This can be found at https://www.hamishmb.com/html/Docs/ddrescue-gui.php.

NOTE: To generate documentation, the directory containing the files in this repo must be called "ddrescue_gui".

Running The Tests
=================

As of v2.1.0, these no longer have to be run as the superuser.

The process for running these is the same on Linux, macOS, and Cygwin.

Without Coverage Reporting
--------------------------
Run:

"python3 ./tests.py"

With Coverage Reporting
-----------------------
Make sure you have installed Coverage.py using pip or your package manager.

Run:

"python3 -m coverage run --rcfile=./.coveragerc ./tests.py"

To run the tests. Then run:

"python3 -m coverage html"

To see the report.
