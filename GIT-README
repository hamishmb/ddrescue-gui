This branch in this repository holds the active development version of DDRescue-GUI. As such, it's very unstable and subject to change at any time, and shouldn't be used on any production machine.

The source code for GNU ddrescue can be downloaded from https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/

The source code for terminal-notifier can be downloaded from https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier

NOTE: To build the documentation, the directory the source tree is in must be called "ddrescue_gui".
